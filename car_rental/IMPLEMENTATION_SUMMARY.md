# Implementation Summary - Cash on Return Payment System

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. Renamed Payment Method
- **Changed:** "Cash on Pickup" → "Cash on Return"
- **Affected Files:**
  - `resources/views/bookings/show.blade.php`
  - `resources/views/bookings/receipt.blade.php`

### 2. Updated Payment Logic

#### Cash Payment Flow:
```
Booking Created → Cash Selected → Active Status
    ↓                  ↓              ↓
status: active    payment_method    payment_status
                  = 'cash'          = 'pending'
                                        ↓
                                  Shows: "Pending (Pay on Return)"
                                        ↓
                            Marked as Done → Payment Auto-Recorded
                                        ↓
                            status: done, payment_status: paid
```

#### Other Payments Flow:
```
Booking Created → Payment Method Selected → Paid Immediately
    ↓                      ↓                      ↓
status: active    (card/mobile banking)    payment_status
                                          = 'paid' (instant)
```

### 3. Controller Updates

**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php`

**payment() Method:**
- If `cash`: Keep `payment_status = 'pending'`, show message about paying on return
- If other methods: Set `payment_status = 'paid'` immediately

**cancel() Method (marks as done):**
- When marking booking as done
- If `payment_method = 'cash'` AND `payment_status = 'pending'`
- Automatically update: `payment_status = 'paid'`, `paid_at = now()`
- Success message includes: "Cash payment has been recorded"

### 4. View Updates

**resources/views/bookings/show.blade.php:**

1. **Payment Status Badge:**
   - For cash during active: "Pending (Pay on Return)"
   - For other pending: "Pending"
   - For paid: "Paid"

2. **Info Alert Added:**
   - Shows when: `payment_method = 'cash'` AND `status = 'active'` AND `payment_status = 'pending'`
   - Message: "You have selected to pay in cash when returning the vehicle. Payment will be collected when the booking is marked as done."

3. **Payment Form Visibility:**
   - Hidden when: `payment_method = 'cash'`
   - Shown when: `payment_status = 'pending'` AND `payment_method ≠ 'cash'`

4. **Cash Instructions Updated:**
   - Title: "Cash on Return"
   - Message: "You will pay cash when returning the vehicle"
   - Note: "Payment will be collected when the booking is marked as done"

**resources/views/bookings/receipt.blade.php:**
