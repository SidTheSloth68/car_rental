# 🚗 Car Search with Date-Based Availability Feature

## Overview
Enhanced car search functionality that filters and displays **only available cars** based on search criteria including dates, ensuring no double-bookings.

---

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. **Date-Based Availability Filtering**
The system now checks actual booking conflicts when users search with dates:

- ✅ Checks if cars are already booked during requested dates
- ✅ Excludes cars with conflicting bookings
- ✅ Only shows truly available cars for the selected period
- ✅ Handles overlapping date ranges correctly

### 2. **Search Parameters**
Users can search by:
- **Pick-up Location** - Where to pick up the car
- **Drop-off Location** - Where to return the car  
- **Pick-up Date** - Start date of rental
- **Return Date** - End date of rental
- **Car Type** - Filter by vehicle type (SUV, Sedan, etc.)
- **Fuel Type** - Filter by fuel type
- **Price Range** - Min/max price filtering
- **Make/Model** - Text search for specific cars

### 3. **Smart Booking Conflict Detection**
The system checks for three types of booking conflicts:

#### Conflict Type 1: New booking starts during existing booking
```
Existing: |----------|
New:           |----------|
Result: CONFLICT ❌
```

#### Conflict Type 2: New booking ends during existing booking
```
Existing:      |----------|
New:      |----------|
Result: CONFLICT ❌
```

#### Conflict Type 3: New booking completely overlaps existing booking
```
Existing:   |-----|
New:      |-----------|
Result: CONFLICT ❌
```

Only bookings with status `pending`, `confirmed`, or `active` are considered as conflicts.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### CarController@index Method
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/CarController.php`

```php
// Filter by date availability - check if car is not booked during requested dates
if ($request->filled('pickup_date') && $request->filled('return_date')) {
    $pickupDate = $request->pickup_date;
    $returnDate = $request->return_date;
    
    // Get IDs of cars that have conflicting bookings
    $bookedCarIds = \App\Models\Booking::where(function($q) use ($pickupDate, $returnDate) {
        $q->whereBetween('start_date', [$pickupDate, $returnDate])
          ->orWhereBetween('end_date', [$pickupDate, $returnDate])
          ->orWhere(function($q) use ($pickupDate, $returnDate) {
              $q->where('start_date', '<=', $pickupDate)
                ->where('end_date', '>=', $returnDate);
          });
    })
    ->whereIn('status', ['pending', 'confirmed', 'active'])
    ->pluck('car_id')
    ->toArray();
    
    // Exclude booked cars
    if (!empty($bookedCarIds)) {
        $query->whereNotIn('id', $bookedCarIds);
    }
}
```

### Search Flow
1. **User enters search criteria** in homepage form
2. **Form submits** to `POST /cars/search`
3. **CarController@search** redirects to `GET /cars` with query parameters
4. **CarController@index** applies all filters including date availability
5. **Results page** shows only available cars matching criteria

---

## 🎯 User Experience

### Before Search
- User sees all featured cars on homepage
- Hero section has enabled search form
- All form fields are active and ready for input

### During Search
1. User fills in:
   - Pick-up location: "New York"
   - Drop-off location: "New York"
   - Pick-up date: "2025-10-15"
   - Return date: "2025-10-20"
2. Clicks "SEARCH CARS" button
3. System processes search with date conflict checking

### After Search
- **Cars page displays** only vehicles available for Oct 15-20, 2025
- **Booked cars are excluded** automatically
- **Search criteria preserved** for user reference
- **No double-booking possible** - only truly available cars shown

---

## 📊 Database Queries

### Query Performance
- **Efficient**: Single query to find conflicting bookings
- **Indexed**: Uses `car_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status` fields
- **Scalable**: Uses `whereNotIn` with array of booked car IDs

### Booking Status Filtering
Only these statuses block availability:
- ✅ `pending` - Customer initiated, awaiting confirmation
- ✅ `confirmed` - Booking confirmed, car reserved
- ✅ `active` - Currently rented out

These statuses DON'T block availability:
- ⭕ `completed` - Past rental, car returned
- ⭕ `cancelled` - Booking cancelled, car available
- ⭕ `rejected` - Booking rejected, car available

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Car is Available
```
Search: Oct 15-20, 2025
Existing Bookings: Oct 1-10, 2025 (completed)
Result: Car SHOWN ✅
```

#### Scenario 2: Car is Partially Booked
```
Search: Oct 15-20, 2025
Existing Bookings: Oct 18-25, 2025 (confirmed)
Result: Car HIDDEN ❌ (overlap detected)
```

#### Scenario 3: Car is Fully Booked
```
Search: Oct 15-20, 2025
Existing Bookings: Oct 10-30, 2025 (active)
Result: Car HIDDEN ❌ (completely overlapped)
```

#### Scenario 4: Cancelled Booking
```
Search: Oct 15-20, 2025
Existing Bookings: Oct 15-20, 2025 (cancelled)
Result: Car SHOWN ✅ (cancelled bookings don't block)
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Date Search
**User Input:**
```
Pickup Date: 2025-10-15
Return Date: 2025-10-20
```

**Query:**
```
GET /cars?pickup_date=2025-10-15&return_date=2025-10-20
```

**Result:**

```

## 📋 Additional Features

### Always Applied Filters
- ✅ **Status filter**: Only shows cars where `is_available = true`
- ✅ **Guest protection**: Non-admin users never see unavailable cars
- ✅ **Pagination**: Results paginated (12 cars per page)
- ✅ **Sorting**: Results sorted by date (newest first) by default

### Search Parameter Preservation
All search parameters are passed to the view:
```php
$searchParams = [
    'pickup_location' => $request->pickup_location,
    'dropoff_location' => $request->dropoff_location,
    'pickup_date' => $request->pickup_date,
    'return_date' => $request->return_date,
    'car_type' => $request->car_type,
    'fuel_type' => $request->fuel_type,
    'search' => $request->search,
];
```

This allows the view to:
- Display current search criteria
- Keep form fields filled with previous values
- Allow easy modification of search

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- Date format validation (Y-m-d)
- Pickup date must be >= today
- Return date must be > pickup date
- XSS protection via Laravel's sanitization

### Authorization
- Non-admin users: See only available cars
- Admin users: Can see all cars (for management)
- Guest users: Can search but not book without login

---
